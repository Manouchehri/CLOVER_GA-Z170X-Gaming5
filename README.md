# EFI/CLOVER for Gigabyte Z170X-Gaming 5 based Customac

This is to document the software part of a Customac build, especially the CLOVER folder in the EFI System Partition of my SSD.

Philosophy of the build and hardware choice are described more extensively (in French) [in a series of articles on my blog](http://blog.barijaona.com/macintosh/Jirokaki/ "Jir≈çkaki on barijaona.com").

To sumarize the hardware :

- Motherboard : Gigabyte GA-Z170X-Gaming 5 (rev 1.0)
- CPU : Intel Skylake Core i5-6600K 3.5 - 3.9 GHz
- Graphics card : MSI GTX960 GAMING 2G
- Wifi/Bluetooth : built from a genuine Apple Airport card, which uses a BCM94360CD chipset.

Some personal details, especially serial numbers, will not be published in this repository.

For increased legitibility, sources or .dsl of DSDT/SSDT patches (which are .aml files in the `ACPI/patched` folder) will be put in the `patched-sources` folder.
